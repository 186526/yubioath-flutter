== Custom OATH Account Icons
Yubico Authenticator supports displaying icons for OATH accounts based on the account's issuer value. This feature makes it easier to navigate in the account list.

=== Setup
To enable custom OATH account icons, provide an icon pack archive in the https://github.com/beemdevelopment/Aegis/blob/master/docs/iconpacks.md[Aegis Icon Pack format]. This archive can be built from scratch or one can use existing prebuilt packages from https://aegis-icons.github.io/ or https://github.com/alexbakker/aegis-simple-icons.

Once the icon pack is present, use the OATH menu in the application and select "Custom Icons". In the dialog, load the icon pack file.

Accounts which have icons in the icon pack will be rendered with the icons.

The "Custom Icons" dialog can be used to remove or replace the currently used icon pack.
